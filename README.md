### About this project
This project is created for an education center and divided into three parts: Admin Panel, FrontEnd and BackEnd parts.

## 1. FrontEnd Part
On this project we used many libraries, [Material-ui](https://material-ui.com/) library to design and make more beautiful the FrontEnd part, for example.
**react-owl-carousel** to carousel the images and others.

## 2. BackEnd Part
BackEnd part is built with the help of Node.js. And this part is connected to MySql, I mean the data comes from MySql.  

## 3. Admin Panel
If you want to add more information, edit or delete the information you will be able to do these kinds of jobs in Admin Panel. So when you make changes, these changes are also affects to your data which is stored in MySql. This means that, for instance, if you add information about the teachers, this information will also add to the MySql and you can see it on the screen. It is simple, just run your admin panel and make changes how many you want.
